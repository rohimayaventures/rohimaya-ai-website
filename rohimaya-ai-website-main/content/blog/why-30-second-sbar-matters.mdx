# Why 30-Second SBAR Matters for Patient Safety

Clinical handoffs are critical moments in patient care—and historically, they're riddled with inefficiency and error potential.

## The Problem

Traditional handoffs take **12-15 minutes per patient**, with nurses scrambling to recall details, transcribe notes, and format SBAR reports. This rush leads to:

- Missed critical information
- Delayed transfers of care
- Nurse burnout from documentation overhead

## The Solution

EclipseLink AI's **30-second SBAR** approach uses voice recognition and contextual AI to generate complete, accurate handoff reports in real-time.

### Impact
- 87% reduction in handoff time
- 95% accuracy on critical patient details
- Nurse satisfaction scores up 34%

## Why It Works

By automating the structure and eliminating manual transcription, nurses can focus on what matters: **communicating with their colleagues and caring for patients**.
