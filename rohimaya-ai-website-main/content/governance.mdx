# Governance & Ethics

At Rohimaya Health AI, we believe AI in healthcare must be transparent, accountable, and aligned with clinical best practices.

---

## Responsible AI Principles

### 1. Clinical Safety First
- All AI models undergo validation against clinical standards
- Human-in-the-loop design for critical decisions
- Continuous monitoring for model drift and bias

### 2. Data Privacy & Security
- HIPAA-compliant architecture with end-to-end encryption
- No patient data used for model training without explicit consent
- Regular third-party security audits (SOC 2 Type II planned for 2027)

### 3. Transparency & Explainability
- Clinicians can view AI reasoning for all predictions
- Model performance metrics published publicly
- Clear disclosure of AI involvement to patients

### 4. Equity & Fairness
- Models tested across diverse patient populations
- Bias detection and mitigation in training pipelines
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all interfaces

### 5. Regulatory Compliance
- FDA guidance alignment for clinical decision support
- State medical board collaboration on scope of practice
- Regular legal review of AI-assisted workflows
